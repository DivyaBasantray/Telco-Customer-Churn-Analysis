-- STEP 1: BASIC DATA OVERVIEW (STRUCTURE AND QUALITY CHECK)
-- A) CREATE TABLE STRUCTURE

DESCRIBE customers;

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM customers;

-- B) PREVIEW 1ST 10 ROWS 

SELECT * 
FROM customers
LIMIT 10;

-- C) CHECK TOTAL NUMBER OF ROWS 

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM customers;

-- D) CHECK FOR DUPLICATE customerIDS 

SELECT customerID,
COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM customers
GROUP BY customerID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- E) CHECK FOR NULL AND BLANK VALUES IN EACH COLUMN 

SELECT
	SUM(CASE WHEN customerID IS NULL OR customerID = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_customerID,
	SUM(CASE WHEN gender IS NULL OR gender = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_gender,
	SUM(CASE WHEN SeniorCitizen IS NULL OR SeniorCitizen = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_SeniorCitizen,
	SUM(CASE WHEN Partner IS NULL OR Partner = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_Partner,
	SUM(CASE WHEN Dependents IS NULL OR Dependents = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_Dependents,
	SUM(CASE WHEN tenure IS NULL OR tenure = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_tenure,
	SUM(CASE WHEN PhoneService IS NULL OR PhoneService = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_PhoneService,
	SUM(CASE WHEN MultipleLines IS NULL OR MultipleLines = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_MultipleLines,
	SUM(CASE WHEN InternetService IS NULL OR InternetService = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_InternetService,
	SUM(CASE WHEN OnlineSecurity IS NULL OR OnlineSecurity = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_OnlineSecurity,
	SUM(CASE WHEN OnlineBackup IS NULL OR OnlineBackup = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_OnlineBackup,
	SUM(CASE WHEN DeviceProtection IS NULL OR DeviceProtection = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_DeviceProtection,
	SUM(CASE WHEN TechSupport IS NULL OR TechSupport = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_TechSupport,
	SUM(CASE WHEN StreamingTV IS NULL OR StreamingTV = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_StreamingTV,
	SUM(CASE WHEN StreamingMovies IS NULL OR StreamingMovies = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_StreamingMovies,
	SUM(CASE WHEN Contract IS NULL OR Contract = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_Contract,
	SUM(CASE WHEN PaperlessBilling IS NULL OR PaperlessBilling = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_PaperlessBilling,
	SUM(CASE WHEN PaymentMethod IS NULL OR PaymentMethod = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_PaymentMethod,
	SUM(CASE WHEN MonthlyCharges IS NULL OR MonthlyCharges = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_MonthlyCharges,
	SUM(CASE WHEN TotalCharges IS NULL OR TotalCharges = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_TotalCharges,
	SUM(CASE WHEN Churn IS NULL OR Churn = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_Churn  
FROM customers;

-- F) CHECK RANGE FOR NUMERIC VALUES

SELECT
	MIN(tenure) AS Min_tenure,
	MAX(tenure) AS Max_tenure,
	MIN(MonthlyCharges) AS Min_MonthlyCharges,
	MAX(MonthlyCharges) AS Max_MonthlyCharges,
	MIN(TotalCharges) AS Min_TotalCharges,
	MAX(TotalCharges) AS Max_TotalCharges
FROM customers;

-- G) CHECK UNIQUE CATEGORIES IN IMPORTANT COLUMNS

SELECT DISTINCT gender 
FROM customers;

SELECT DISTINCT InternetService 
FROM customers;

SELECT DISTINCT Contract 
FROM customers;

SELECT DISTINCT PaymentMethod 
FROM customers;

SELECT DISTINCT Churn 
FROM customers;

-- STEP 2: DATA CLEANING & TYPE CORRECTION
-- A) CHECK WHAT'S INSIDE SeniorCitizen (CONFIRM ISSUE)

SELECT DISTINCT SeniorCitizen 
FROM customers;

-- B) REPLACE BLANKS OR NULLS IN SeniorCitizen WITH 0 (ASSUMING MISSING MEANS "NOT A SENIOR")

UPDATE customers
SET SeniorCitizen = 0
WHERE SeniorCitizen IS NULL OR SeniorCitizen = '';

-- THEN CONVERT COLUMN TYPE INTO INTEGER:

ALTER TABLE customers
MODIFY SeniorCitizen INT;

-- C) FIX TotalCharges
-- i) FIND ROWS WITH BLANK OR NON-NUMERIC VALUES:

SELECT customerID, TotalCharges
FROM customers
WHERE TRIM(TotalCharges) = '' OR TotalCharges REGEXP'[^0-9.]';

-- ii) SET THOSE BLANKS TO NULL:

UPDATE customers
SET TotalCharges = NULL
WHERE TRIM(TotalCharges) = '' OR TotalCharges REGEXP '[^0-9.]';

-- iii) CONVERT TotalCharges COLUMN TO A PROPER NUMERIC TYPE:

ALTER TABLE customers
MODIFY TotalCharges DECIMAL (10,2);

-- D)  CHECK THE MISSING TENURE ROWS

SELECT customerID, tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
FROM customers
WHERE tenure IS NULL OR tenure = '';

-- *) FINAL CLEANING FIX 
-- a) REPLACE BLANKS IN TotalCharges WITH 0 

UPDATE customers
SET TotalCharges = 0
WHERE TRIM(TotalCharges) = '' OR TotalCharges IS NULL;

-- b) CONVERT TotalCharges TO DECIMAL

ALTER TABLE customers
MODIFY TotalCharges DECIMAL (10,2); 

-- C) VERIFY THE FIX

SELECT MIN(TotalCharges), MAX(TotalCharges)
FROM customers; 

--  STEP 3: EXPORT THE CLEANED DATA FOR EDA

SELECT *
